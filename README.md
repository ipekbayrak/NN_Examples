# NN_Examples
my very first attempts to involve in deep learning, machine learning and neural networks
## NN_BP_Sum.py
back propagation neural network which learns sum operation and applies it 
## NN_RNN_Sum.py
RNN network which learns sum operation for given bit range
### Upcomning Projects
- improvement in sum. 
- adding 4 operations
- addin logic gates
- image recognition
- machine learning fake news detector
